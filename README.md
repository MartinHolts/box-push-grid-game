# Sokoban game

This repository contains a simple puzzle game I made. I focused more on learning javascript, than having pretty graphics. I wanted to try out creating a simple game in javascript with different loops, while using simple ASCII character graphics.

## Playing Guide

1. Use the arrow keys to control the player character and push boxes.
2. Your goal is to push all boxes onto the target tiles to complete each level.
